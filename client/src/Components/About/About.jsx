          Kerala is a southern Indian state located on the south-western part of
          the peninsula. The state of Kerala is endowed with rich tropical
          evergreen forests, beautiful sandy beaches and emerald green palm
          groves. The lofty Sahyadri range along the length of the state forms
          its eastern boundary. The mountains are a heaven for rich biodiversity
          and is nature's cradle for speciation. Infact, the state language
          Malayalam derives its etymology from these alluring mountains,
          wherein, 'mala' means mountain and 'al' means a person. The 580
          kilometer long west coast line abutting the Arabian sea, forms the
          western boundary of the state. Scenic backwaters, fresh water lakes
          and rivers dot the whole landscape. Kerala state is also known for its
          high ranking in Human Development Indices. UNDP report on HDI for 2018
          has ranked Kerala at the top among all the states in India. The
          epithet God's own country to Kerala is hence, well deserved. Kerala is
          also known for having the largest number of expatriate population
          settled in various parts of the world. High levels of literacy
          combined with legitimate expectations of high service delivery
          standards among the citizens pose refreshing challenges to the state
          administration and the Law enforcement agencies.
